download data from: https://mainstream.ghan.nl/export.html or: https://benjaminbenben.com/lastfm-to-csv/

Place the csv in the same folder as the python script

Specify the graph you want:

  e.g. f(10,artists,0) will produce a graph of your top 10 artists of all time (days=0 will give all time)
  
  and f(15,tracks,100) will produce a graph of your top 15 tracks in the past 100 days
